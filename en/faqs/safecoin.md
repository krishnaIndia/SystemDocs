# Safecoins

### What gives safecoin value?

Safecoin has value because it has utility. Users can earn safecoin by [farming](http://www.maidsafe.net/SystemDocs/how_to_use_it/farmers.html) safecoin and use it to buy more storage, and access applications and services on the network. It will also be possible to purchase safecoin via exchanges, as the network launches, and this will also provide safecoin with a direct fiat valuation.

The underlying network also provides safecoin with additional value in a less obvious way, via the transaction mechanism within the network (the SAFE Networkâ€™s version of the block chain). Capable of processing millions of transactions per second and able to confirm transactions at network speed, the currency is instantly redeemable, secure and anonymous on wallets that are easy to use and built in to the network. These features are well suited to buying not only network services, but also products being sold on the network by merchants.

### How is safecoin valued?

While the number of users on the SAFE Network is increasing there is a virtuous circle:

* More safecoin will be held in new wallets, as most users will be Farmers by default.
* This will increase liquidity and distribute wealth, providing almost all users with at least a few safecoin in their wallet.
* Users may exchange their safecoin for network services, or for cash (or another digital currency) using an exchange.

The ratio of safecoin being saved (left in new wallets) versus the ratio being issued to Farmers will produce a value point.

The volume of supply and demand will grow with the network, which tends to create an increasingly stable currency that increases in value over time. Value grows because it is linked to its usefulness (incentive to hold, which also increases over time), and the increasing number of users of the network (people wanting to hold it).

Over time this virtuous circle becomes stronger (as the volume increases) because the number of users is growing. The incentive to hold and use safecoin will also increase due to the addition of applications and services. Speculation will disrupt this of course, but the network provides a real value anchor that will help to dampen this impact.

###Is the entire amount of safecoins going to be released when the SAFE Network goes live?

No. The remaining safecoins will be generated by the network gradually and at a speed that is determined by how much the network is used.
