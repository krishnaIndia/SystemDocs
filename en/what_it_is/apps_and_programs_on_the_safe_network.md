#Apps and programs on the SAFE Network

The SAFE Network is also a platform for apps and programs that can be accessed by the network users.

Here are some examples of the type of apps that can be used on the SAFE Network.

* Cloud storage
* Encrypted messaging
* Web sites
* VoIP
* Social networks
* Distributed databases
* Document or contract signing
* Any existing service that runs on the Internet

The apps and programs contain cryptographically secured key pairs and can use these to automatically sign requests for session management or membership of any network service.

For example, a website with membership can present a join button and clicking that would automatically sign an authority and allow access in the future.
