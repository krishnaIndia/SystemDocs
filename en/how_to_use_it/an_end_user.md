# An End User

An End User is a participant on the network who utilises the client side software to use applications created by App Builders. While they may only be 
End Users, they may also belong to any, or all of the other user groups.

An End User may decide not to become a Farmer, for example, as they have no additional resource to offer the network (they maybe running their own 
computer near capacity), or they use a mobile device, such as a phone or a tablet, as their primary method of network access. While it is planned that 
mobile devices will be able to earn safecoin, some manufacturers force disconnection of data after the screen has switched off, making them suboptimal 
farming devices. 

Creating accounts and consuming data, such as a publicly shared pages, are free on the SAFE Network, however, using applications will require safecoin. 
End Users who are not Farmers, Core Developers or App Builders will need to acquire safecoin from decentralised exchanges.
