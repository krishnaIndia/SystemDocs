# Accurate p2p network proximity assessment

To ensure quick and accurate transfers of data between Vaults it is vital for the SAFE Network to be able to identify other Vaults that are in the same proximity. The network needs to be able to monitor the status of Vaults and data at all times, with all decisions on the network being made only in consensus with other Vaults.

To do this, Vaults use an enhanced distributed hash table (DHT) to manage the identification and confirmation of Vaults in the same network area. Being optimised for efficiency and accuracy enables the network to globally reconfigure very rapidly (between 20ms and 5 seconds).
