# Resilience - Autonomous network
The SAFE Network is a resilient and autonomous network. There are many factors that have an impact on a network's performance and its ability to adapt to a changing environment. These factors have to be assessed and handled without the intervention of humans or large server systems.

The requirements of the resilient SAFE Network are as follows:

* Cryptographically secured
* A system of guaranteed Vault identification
* A peer to peer (p2p) network that is very accurate and can guarantee Vault proximity to any address
* Ensure home routers are able to allow connections both ways (NAT traversal)
* A mechanism where users can prove they have provided resources
* A mechanism of resource measurement and reward
* Dealing with very high levels of churn (computers going off and on, potentially staying off)
* The power to remove any administrative requirement

By meeting all these requirements the SAFE Network is able to support a network that can adapt quickly and automatically to hostile network environments, such as the Internet.
