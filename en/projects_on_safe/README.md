# Projects on SAFE

These are project announced or under discussion on [maidsafe.org](https://www.maidsafe.org). Additional projects who contact MaidSafe directly may be placed here in time. We strongly encourage projects to announce what they are doing to the community as opposed to making direct to MaidSafe.

We work very hard to ensure this is a true community project and while direct contact is acceptable, private deals will not be done for any project that influences or attempts to influence the core design. Everything has to be community knowledge as we find it works much better to enlist rather than use the community.
