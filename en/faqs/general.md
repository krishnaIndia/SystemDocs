### Why the name MaidSafe?

Itâ€™s an acronym: Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone.


### Who owns the SAFE Network?

We all do! The SAFE Network is an Open Source resource there for all users of the Internet. The network is completely anonymous, secure and aims to repel human intervention of any kind; it cannot be controlled or 'owned'. We feel very strongly about this and have written a [blog post](http://blog.maidsafe.net/2014/02/07/owning-the-network/) on the subject.

###A truly autonomous distributed network shouldn't need patents to protect it, right?

Our patents exist in a purely defensive capacity, to protect MaidSafe and the developers that use the platform. MaidSafe do not own the patents, they only have the rights to use them, royalty free and in perpetuity. The MaidSafe Foundation, a registered charity, actually own the patents.

###MaidSafe technology is nothing new; are you just throwing up marketing hype around it then mentioning Bitcoin?

Our papers, patents and design documents describe crypto currencies being crucial to a distributed network (otherwise identity leaks are inevitable). They're all available online with early design specifications (such as Perpetual Coin) and were published in 2006, as were many of our initial patents.
