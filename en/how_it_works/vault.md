# Vaults
Vaults are created on a user's computer when they install the MaidSafe client and join the SAFE Network.

The Vault on the user's computer can not be seen by the user. Instead the user sees a virtual mounted drive that provides access to their distributed data.

When a user creates or alters files on their virtual drive, the file goes through several processes to ensure the file is secure and makes best use of the SAFE Network resources.

## Vault persona
Vaults can have a different data handling persona. Each persona serves a different role in the SAFE Network.
* **Client managers**<br/>
Client manager Vaults receives the chunks of self encrypted data from the user's Vault.
* **Data managers**<br/>
These Vaults manage the chunks of data from the Client manager Vaults. They also monitor the status of the SAFE Network.
* **Data holders**<br/>
Data holder Vaults are used to hold the chunks of data.
* **Data holder managers**<br/>
Data holder managers monitor the Data holder Vaults. They report to the Data manager if any of the chunks are corrupted or changed. They also report when a Data holder has gone offline.
* **Vault managers**<br/>
The Vault manager keeps the software updated and the Vault running; restarting it on any error.
* **Transaction managers**<br/>
The Transaction manager helps to manage safecoin tranfers.

## Data on the SAFE Network

There are 2 mechanisms utilised by the network that authorise an End User to carry out certain actions via the Client. Authority is obtained by group consensus whenever a Client is putting (storing) new data. Alternatively, [cryptographic signatures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) are used if the Client is amending already stored data (a version) or sending safecoin, for example.

** Group Consensus**<br/>
When an End User attempts to put a new piece of data, the file is encrypted and broken up into chunks as part of the self encryption process, it is passed to a close group of Client managers. This close group are comprised of the closest vault IDs to the users vault ID in terms of [XOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) distance. This is distance measured in the mathematical sense as opposed to the geographical sense. At least twenty eight of the thirty two Client managers much reach consensus before any network operations are carried out.

The Client managers then pass the chunks to thirty two Data managers, chosen by the network as their IDs are closest to the IDs of the data chunk, so the chunk ID also determines it's location on the network.

The network utilises a Scatter/Gather approach, based on [Rabinâ€™s Information Dispersal Algorithm](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/rabin2011-slides/rabin2011-mitzenmacher.pdf), enabling small data loss (up to 4 pieces) without the requirement to retransmit data

Once consensus is reached, the Data manager passes the chunks to thirty two Data holder managers, who in turn pass the chunks for storage with Data holders. If a Data holder manager reports that a Data holder has gone offline, the Data manager decides, based on rankings assigned to Vaults, into which other Vault to put the chunk of data.

This way the chunks of data from the original file are constantly being monitored and supported to ensure the original data can be accessed and decrypted by the original user.

Any movement of data chunks can only be made if there is a consensus (28 of 32) from the surrounding Vaults. The Vaults cannot act in isolation.

All communications on the SAFE Network are carried out through close groups of 32 nodes. This prevents a rogue node(s) from behaving maliciously. It is not possible for a user to choose their own node ID, or to decide where their data is stored, this is calculated by the network. Every time a node disconnects from the network and reconnects, it is assigned a totally new and random ID.

** Cryptographic Signatures**<br/>
When End Users are making changes to existing data, such as changing the content of a file, or sending another End User safecoin, the network does not use group consensus as this layer of complexity and increased network load is not required. 

Cryptographic signatures mathematically validate the owner of any piece of data and can prove this beyond any doubt, provided the End User has kept their private key safe. If the End User is the owner of any piece of data and can prove this, by digitally signing their request with their private key, the network permits them access to change the data.
