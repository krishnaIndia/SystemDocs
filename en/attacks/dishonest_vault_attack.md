# Dishonest Vault attack

##Attack description

In this attack, a Vault falsely claims to offer a higher storage capacity than it actually has available.

##Attack purpose

The purpose of this attack is to gain the ability to join particular areas of the SAFE Network and to create fake rules affecting it's behaviour, similar to the "50% attack" often seen in cryptographic currencies.

In large scale attacks of this kind, considerable damage to the SAFE Network would be possible including theft or double spend of safecoins, or the deletion of data.

The goal of this may be simply to destroy user trust in the SAFE Network.

##Attack avoidance

The SAFE Network requires a quorum level of legitimate Vaults to be instructed in order for a request to be accepted, which mitigates the risk of this attack.

A botnet or other group of malicious Vaults would require to make up around 75% of the whole SAFE Network to achieve false quorum over invalid requests, making a successful attack of this type very unlikely.
