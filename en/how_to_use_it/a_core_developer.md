# A Core Developer

As a Core Developer, a C++ developer contributes to the SAFE Network codebase and is directly rewarded with safecoins.

Developers work on the SAFE network core libraries, which are written exclusively in C++, according to a coding standard and with the support of mailing lists and community resources. In addition to the core team, there are decentralized Core Developer pods world-wide which exist to disseminate project knowledge and aid development.

The amount of safecoins awarded to a Core Developer is determined by their contribution, and payments are allocated from the MaidSafe Foundation from a reserve of 5% of all safecoins set aside for this purpose.
