# Network churn
Network churn is a term to describe Vaults going online and offline frequently and without notice. This is a situation that favours a quickly reconfiguring network.

A Vault's distance from an address is a measure of that Vaults authority to make decisions on that address in a particular circumstance.

In terms of data loss, the replicated copies of data are spread across the network in a random and uniform manner. This should also geographically disperse the data copies for increased redundancy.

In terms of security, network churn prevents attacks as the point of access is constantly moving.

As the network re-configures quickly on network churn events, the shape of the network alters around any data.
