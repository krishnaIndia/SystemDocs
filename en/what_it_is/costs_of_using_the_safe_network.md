#Accessing the SAFE Network
The SAFE client is a program used to log in to and access the SAFE Network. After starting the SAFE client you are asked to provide login details.

* Keyword
* PIN
* Password

With these details the SAFE Network authenticates the user on the SAFE Network and decrypts their data atlas, which provides them with access to all their encrypted data.

The SAFE client is a small, cross-platform (Windows, Mac and Linux) and non-resource intensive program that does not impact your computer's performance. After you have been authenticated through the SAFE client you do not have to enter further passwords or keys to access other shared data or apps on the SAFE Network.

No passwords or log in details are cached by the SAFE client or stored on the network. This means that no details about you or your access security is left on the PC you have used to access the SAFE Network. You can log in to the SAFE Network from another PC that has the SAFE client installed.

As well as the SAFE client, users also require safecoins to access the SAFE Network. Safecoins are the token-based currency of the SAFE Network.

To earn safecoins users can do the following:

* Donating spare computer resources to the network
* Creating network applications
* Contributing to the underlying SAFE Network codebase.

It is anticipated that soon after public launch, it will also be possible to buy safecoins from decentralised exchanges that will exist on the SAFE Network.
